Request to use package for Pulsar

Hello! As you may have heard already, Atom will be sunset at the end of this year. You can read more here if you haven't heard the news already: <https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/>

[Pulsar](https://github.com/pulsar-edit) are an organisation created with the goal to keep maintaining Atom under a new name (to avoid legal issues). As a courtesy, we would like to request permission to migrate your package from [atom.io](https://atom.io/packages) to our new Pulsar packages backend, once we get it deployed.
